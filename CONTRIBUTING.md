# Contribute to Hayya

Hello there ğŸ‘‹,

Happy to know that you're interested to contribute to this project.

This is a brief page that describes the guidelines to contribution in order for us all to keep this project clean and organized.

## Types of contributions

* **New feature**: Oh cool ğŸ˜ƒ! So you have a new idea? We would be happy to see it working. Please keep in mind that this project targets busy people like you and me and new features should never make the `Hayya` syntax more complicated.
* **Bug fix**: You're awesome! Let's fix that together.
* **Code improvement**: These are the contributions that bring improvements to the structure, code, performance...

## Issues creation
The first step of any contribution is to write an issue for it in which you describe the idea or bug.

Fortunately for busy people like us, we have created templates for each one of the types mentioned above, so you should be able to create the issue in a very short time.

Then you can proceed working on the contribution following the guide below, or stop here and let other contributor work on it if they want.

## Branch naming
To keep things in order we have a simple convention for our branch naming.

The branch you are creating should be prefixed according to the contribution type:

| Type             | Prefix   |
|------------------|----------|
| New feature      | `feat/`  |
| Bug fix          | `fix/`   |
| Code improvement | `chore/` |

## Commits
Same as for branches, the commits should have a certain format, as following:
```
type: make something
----  --------------
|     |-> The message should start with a verbe in the present tense
|
|
|-> feat, fix or chore
```

## Testing
This project was written in a TDD approach making the test coverage at almost âœ… ğŸ’¯%. So let's keep this coverage rate that high ğŸš€.
